<h4><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>Best self help book</h4>
<p>
Here are a few books. They have changed the way our look at the world and the way our react to the world.
However, books cannot change your life – only you can do that. Simply reading the book alone, then moving on to the next one is useless.

The books can guide you down the right path, but you must take massive action and dedicate yourself to doing 
the work.</p>

        <div class="text1"><h1><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>Study Plan!!!</h1>
          <h6>by Shub Mishra (orion)...</h6>

        <pre> As you all know many of us don't even read our daily books of syllabi, and as human psychological fact
  we all know we can  concentrate on any thing for about 5mins or less and it's tough to read ebooks,
  book on phones ,pc or tabs ,sometimes you read and then there comes a pop-up notifying -"someone's has
  started following you" and many such more which almost distracts our brain and which in the end leads to
  stop of our reading.</pre>
<p class="text2">I will tell you few things which will help you to get best of ebooks/books.</p>



<pre>      Point 1- Carry a pen and notebook/diary or pages where you can write.
      Point 2- before reading turn off your internet and other applications.
      Point 3-Before reading drink a glass of water which will help your brain in good oxygen content.
      Point 4- Have some nuts or fruits which will help you from getting stressed eyes or body.
      Point 5- Fix your time for how much minute you are going to read till then you don't have to 
      think of anything or do any work .(for that find a suitable place in your house where you can sit alone)
      (tell your parents ,friends,and you family members not to disturb for that period of time).
      Point-6 now start reading your book/ebook at the end of para recall what you have read ,try to
      understand what's written their ,what it is conveying the message try to relate with your daily life.
      (consider you are reading Newton's law then try to relate it with daily life like if you are traveling,or
      play physical sports it would give better understanding and you will remember it for longer time).
      Point 7-Write a short note of that paragraph for better revision in future.

  At last in this world moving so fast people know to eat pizza and burger and to have coke but don't know how
  to read and it's common mistakes in everyone's life.
  And unfortunately we have never been taught how to read ,understand and implement not in school as well as in
  colleges.

  Life is so one and it's wonderful don't regret of what you have done mistakes in the past try to move on and
  work on your present to improve your future.
  Hope it would help most of the people .
  My ambition from this post is to motivate people abould reading and motivating people to learn before earn.
  Thank you
    Orion

            <a href="" ><img src="img12.jpg">  </a> 
            <p>This is probably the best financial book one can get. It gives you a very clear idea about how money is generated and how you can make it work for you. The line "Don't work for money, Let the money work for you" is so true. I was not much into this financial stuff until I read this book. I can definitely say it changed my life and the way I look at money. This book is not only about money. It's about how we are taught to think; how we are programmed by schools, family, and friends/peers to look at the rich as greedy and opportunities as risks. It is about changing our mindset towards the way we handle our finances - to look at why we do what we do, how and why do we end up spending our hard earned money in luxuries and other stuffs, and how to handle them in a better way. A must read for everyone to manage your life and finances in a smarter way!</p></td>
